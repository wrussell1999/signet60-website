## What is SigneT60?
In 1963, 4 SigneTs crossed the Channel - just to prove they could!

60 years ago, a small convoy of sturdy little dinghies set out to disprove the myth around seaworthiness of SigneTs. This year the SigneT Class Owners Association will be completing a tribute to this voyage in aid of RNLI and Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust!
